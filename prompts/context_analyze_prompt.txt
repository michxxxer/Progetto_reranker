You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of retrieved context for answering questions. Analyze this question-context pair carefully.

Question: {question}
Context: {context}

First, analyze the retrieved context by considering:
1. What specific information in the context directly addresses the question?
2. What key information needed to answer the question is missing from the context?

After your analysis, provide the following scores:

Relevance Score (0.00-1.00):
- 0.00: Completely irrelevant, contains no information related to the question
- 0.25: Minimally relevant, contains only tangential information
- 0.50: Moderately relevant, contains some useful information but misses key aspects
- 0.75: Highly relevant, addresses most aspects of the question
- 1.00: Perfectly relevant, directly addresses all aspects of the question

Sufficiency Score (bool):
- False: Insufficient, doesn't provide the necessary information for answering
- True: Completely sufficient, provides all information needed for a comprehensive answer

For your response, use this exact format:

Relevance Score: [score]
Sufficiency Score: [bool]
